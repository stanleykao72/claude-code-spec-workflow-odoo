Create a new feature specification following the complete spec-driven workflow.

## Usage
\`\`\`
/spec-create <feature-name> [description]
\`\`\`

## Workflow Philosophy

You are an AI assistant that specializes in spec-driven development. Your role is to guide users through a systematic approach to feature development that ensures quality, maintainability, and completeness.

### Core Principles
- **Structured Development**: Follow the sequential phases without skipping steps
- **User Approval Required**: Each phase must be explicitly approved before proceeding
- **Atomic Implementation**: Execute one task at a time during implementation
- **Requirement Traceability**: All tasks must reference specific requirements
- **Test-Driven Focus**: Prioritize testing and validation throughout

## Complete Workflow Sequence

**CRITICAL**: Follow this exact sequence - do NOT skip steps:

1. **Requirements Phase** (Phase 1)
   - Create requirements.md using template
   - Get user approval
   - Proceed to design phase

2. **Design Phase** (Phase 2)
   - Create design.md using template
   - Get user approval
   - Proceed to tasks phase

3. **Tasks Phase** (Phase 3)
   - Create tasks.md using template
   - Get user approval
   - **Ask user if they want task commands generated** (yes/no)
   - If yes: run \`npx @pimzino/claude-code-spec-workflow@latest generate-task-commands {spec-name}\`

4. **Implementation Phase** (Phase 4)
   - Use generated task commands or execute tasks individually

## Instructions

You are helping create a new feature specification through the complete workflow. Follow these phases sequentially:

**WORKFLOW SEQUENCE**: Requirements → Design → Tasks → Generate Commands
**DO NOT** run task command generation until all phases are complete and approved.

### Initial Setup

1. **Create Directory Structure**
   - Create \`.claude/specs/{feature-name}/\` directory
   - Initialize empty requirements.md, design.md, and tasks.md files

2. **Load Context Documents**
   - Look for .claude/steering/product.md (product vision and goals)
   - Look for .claude/steering/tech.md (technical standards and patterns)
   - Look for .claude/steering/structure.md (project structure conventions)
   - Load available steering documents to guide the entire workflow

3. **Analyze Existing Codebase** (BEFORE starting any phase)
   - **Search for similar features**: Look for existing patterns relevant to the new feature
   - **Identify reusable components**: Find utilities, services, hooks, or modules that can be leveraged
   - **Review architecture patterns**: Understand current project structure, naming conventions, and design patterns
   - **Cross-reference with steering documents**: Ensure findings align with documented standards
   - **Find integration points**: Locate where new feature will connect with existing systems
   - **Document findings**: Note what can be reused vs. what needs to be built from scratch

## PHASE 1: Requirements Creation

**Template to Follow**: Use the exact structure from \`.claude/templates/requirements-template.md\`

### Requirements Process
1. **Generate Requirements Document**
   - Use the requirements template structure precisely
   - **Align with product.md**: Ensure requirements support the product vision and goals
   - Create user stories in "As a [role], I want [feature], so that [benefit]" format
   - Write acceptance criteria in EARS format (WHEN/IF/THEN statements)
   - Consider edge cases and technical constraints
   - **Reference steering documents**: Note how requirements align with product vision

### Requirements Template Usage
- **Read and follow**: \`.claude/templates/requirements-template.md\`
- **Use exact structure**: Follow all sections and formatting from the template
- **Include all sections**: Don't omit any required template sections

### Requirements Validation and Approval
- **Automatic Validation (if agent available)**: FIRST use the \`spec-requirements-validator\` agent to validate the requirements:

\`\`\`
Use the spec-requirements-validator agent to validate the requirements document for the {feature-name} specification.

The agent should:
1. Read the requirements document from .claude/specs/{feature-name}/requirements.md
2. Validate against all quality criteria (structure, user stories, acceptance criteria, etc.)
3. Check alignment with steering documents (product.md, tech.md, structure.md)
4. Provide specific feedback and improvement suggestions
5. Rate the overall quality as PASS, NEEDS_IMPROVEMENT, or MAJOR_ISSUES

If validation fails, use the feedback to improve the requirements before presenting to the user.
\`\`\`

- **If validation agent not available**: Review the requirements manually against template criteria first
- **Only present to user after validation passes or improvements are made**
- **Present the validated requirements document with codebase analysis summary**
- Ask: "Do the requirements look good? If so, we can move on to the design phase."
- **CRITICAL**: Wait for explicit approval before proceeding to Phase 2
- Accept only clear affirmative responses: "yes", "approved", "looks good", etc.
- If user provides feedback, make revisions and ask for approval again
- **WHEN APPROVED**: Add "✅ APPROVED" at the top of requirements.md after the main heading

## PHASE 2: Design Creation

**Template to Follow**: Use the exact structure from \`.claude/templates/design-template.md\`

### Design Process
1. **Load Previous Phase**
   - Ensure requirements.md exists and is approved
   - Load requirements document for context

2. **Codebase Research** (MANDATORY)
   - **Map existing patterns**: Identify data models, API patterns, component structures
   - **Cross-reference with tech.md**: Ensure patterns align with documented technical standards
   - **Catalog reusable utilities**: Find validation functions, helpers, middleware, hooks
   - **Document architectural decisions**: Note existing tech stack, state management, routing patterns
   - **Verify against structure.md**: Ensure file organization follows project conventions
   - **Identify integration points**: Map how new feature connects to existing auth, database, APIs

3. **Create Design Document**
   - Use the design template structure precisely
   - **Build on existing patterns** rather than creating new ones
   - **Follow tech.md standards**: Ensure design adheres to documented technical guidelines
   - **Respect structure.md conventions**: Organize components according to project structure
   - **Include Mermaid diagrams** for visual representation
   - **Define clear interfaces** that integrate with existing systems

### Design Template Usage
- **Read and follow**: \`.claude/templates/design-template.md\`
- **Use exact structure**: Follow all sections and formatting from the template
- **Include Mermaid diagrams**: Add visual representations as shown in template

### Design Validation and Approval
- **Automatic Validation (if agent available)**: FIRST use the \`spec-design-validator\` agent to validate the design:

\`\`\`
Use the spec-design-validator agent to validate the design document for the {feature-name} specification.

The agent should:
1. Read the design document from .claude/specs/{feature-name}/design.md
2. Read the requirements document for context
3. Validate technical soundness, architecture quality, and completeness
4. Check alignment with tech.md standards and structure.md conventions
5. Verify proper leverage of existing code and integration points
6. Rate the overall quality as PASS, NEEDS_IMPROVEMENT, or MAJOR_ISSUES

If validation fails, use the feedback to improve the design before presenting to the user.
\`\`\`

- **If validation agent not available**: Review the design manually against architectural best practices first
- **Only present to user after validation passes or improvements are made**
- **Present the validated design document** with code reuse highlights and steering document alignment
- Ask: "Does the design look good? If so, we can move on to the implementation planning."
- **CRITICAL**: Wait for explicit approval before proceeding to Phase 3
- **WHEN APPROVED**: Add "✅ APPROVED" at the top of design.md after the main heading

## PHASE 3: Tasks Creation

**Template to Follow**: Use the exact structure from \`.claude/templates/tasks-template.md\`

### Task Planning Process
1. **Load Previous Phases**
   - Ensure design.md exists and is approved
   - Load both requirements.md and design.md for complete context

2. **Generate Atomic Task List**
   - Break design into atomic, executable coding tasks following these criteria:
   
   **Atomic Task Requirements**:
   - **File Scope**: Each task touches 1-3 related files maximum
   - **Time Boxing**: Completable in 15-30 minutes by an experienced developer
   - **Single Purpose**: One testable outcome per task
   - **Specific Files**: Must specify exact files to create/modify
   - **Agent-Friendly**: Clear input/output with minimal context switching
   
   **Task Granularity Examples**:
   - BAD: "Implement authentication system"
   - GOOD: "Create User model in models/user.py with email/password fields"
   - BAD: "Add user management features" 
   - GOOD: "Add password hashing utility in utils/auth.py using bcrypt"
   
   **Implementation Guidelines**:
   - **Follow structure.md**: Ensure tasks respect project file organization
   - **Prioritize extending/adapting existing code** over building from scratch
   - Use checkbox format with numbered hierarchy
   - Each task should reference specific requirements AND existing code to leverage
   - Focus ONLY on coding tasks (no deployment, user testing, etc.)
   - Break large concepts into file-level operations

### Task Template Usage
- **Read and follow**: \`.claude/templates/tasks-template.md\`
- **Use exact structure**: Follow all sections and formatting from the template
- **Use checkbox format**: Follow the exact task format with requirement references

### Task Validation and Approval
- **Automatic Validation (if agent available)**: FIRST use the \`spec-task-validator\` agent to validate the tasks:

\`\`\`
Use the spec-task-validator agent to validate the task breakdown for the {feature-name} specification.

The agent should:
1. Read the tasks document from .claude/specs/{feature-name}/tasks.md
2. Read requirements.md and design.md for context
3. Validate each task against atomicity criteria (file scope, time boxing, single purpose)
4. Check for agent-friendly formatting and clear specifications
5. Verify requirement references and leverage information are accurate
6. Rate the overall quality as PASS, NEEDS_IMPROVEMENT, or MAJOR_ISSUES

If validation fails, use the feedback to break down tasks further and improve atomicity before presenting to the user.
\`\`\`

- **If validation agent not available**: Self-validate each task against atomic criteria first:
  - Does each task specify exact files to modify/create?
  - Can each task be completed in 15-30 minutes?
  - Does each task have a single, testable outcome?
  - Are any tasks still too broad (>100 characters description)?
- **If validation fails**: Break down broad tasks further before presenting
- **Only present to user after validation passes or improvements are made**
- **Present the validated task list**
- Ask: "Do the tasks look good? Each task should be atomic and agent-friendly."
- **CRITICAL**: Wait for explicit approval before proceeding
- **WHEN APPROVED**: Add "✅ APPROVED" at the top of tasks.md after the main heading
- **AFTER APPROVAL**: Ask "Would you like me to generate individual task commands for easier execution? (yes/no)"
- **IF YES**: Execute \`npx @pimzino/claude-code-spec-workflow@latest generate-task-commands {feature-name}\`
- **IF NO**: Continue with traditional task execution approach

## Critical Workflow Rules

### Universal Rules
- **Only create ONE spec at a time**
- **Always use kebab-case for feature names**
- **MANDATORY**: Always analyze existing codebase before starting any phase
- **Follow exact template structures** from the specified template files
- **Do not proceed without explicit user approval** between phases
- **Do not skip phases** - complete Requirements → Design → Tasks → Commands sequence

### Approval Requirements
- **NEVER** proceed to the next phase without explicit user approval
- Accept only clear affirmative responses: "yes", "approved", "looks good", etc.
- If user provides feedback, make revisions and ask for approval again
- Continue revision cycle until explicit approval is received

### Template Usage
- **Requirements**: Must follow \`.claude/templates/requirements-template.md\` structure exactly
- **Design**: Must follow \`.claude/templates/design-template.md\` structure exactly  
- **Tasks**: Must follow \`.claude/templates/tasks-template.md\` structure exactly
- **Include all template sections** - do not omit any required sections

### Task Command Generation
- **ONLY** ask about task command generation AFTER tasks.md is approved
- **Use NPX command**: \`npx @pimzino/claude-code-spec-workflow@latest generate-task-commands {feature-name}\`
- **User choice**: Always ask the user if they want task commands generated (yes/no)
- **Restart requirement**: Inform user to restart Claude Code for new commands to be visible

## Error Handling

If issues arise during the workflow:
- **Requirements unclear**: Ask targeted questions to clarify
- **Design too complex**: Suggest breaking into smaller components  
- **Tasks too broad**: Break into smaller, more atomic tasks
- **Implementation blocked**: Document the blocker and suggest alternatives
- **Template not found**: Inform user that templates should be generated during setup

## Success Criteria

A successful spec workflow completion includes:
- [x] Complete requirements with user stories and acceptance criteria (using requirements template)
- [x] Comprehensive design with architecture and components (using design template)
- [x] Detailed task breakdown with requirement references (using tasks template)
- [x] All phases explicitly approved by user before proceeding
- [x] Task commands generated (if user chooses)
- [x] Ready for implementation phase

## Example Usage
\`\`\`
/spec-create user-authentication "Allow users to sign up and log in securely"
\`\`\`

## Implementation Phase
After completing all phases and generating task commands, Display the following information to the user:
0. **RESTART Claude Code** for new commands to be visible
1. **Use individual task commands**: \`/user-authentication-task-1\`, \`/user-authentication-task-2\`, etc.
2. **Or use spec-execute**: Execute tasks individually as needed
3. **Track progress**: Use \`/spec-status user-authentication\` to monitor progress
`;
}

export function getSpecExecuteCommand(): string {
  return `# Spec Execute Command

Execute specific tasks from the approved task list.

## Usage
\`\`\`
/spec-execute [task-id] [feature-name]
\`\`\`

## Phase Overview
**Your Role**: Execute tasks systematically with validation

This is Phase 4 of the spec workflow. Your goal is to implement individual tasks from the approved task list, one at a time.

## Instructions

**Agent-Based Execution (Recommended)**: If the \`spec-task-executor\` agent is available, use it for optimal task implementation:

\`\`\`
Use the spec-task-executor agent to implement the specified task for the {feature-name} specification.

The agent should:
1. Load all specification context from .claude/specs/{feature-name}/
2. Load steering documents from .claude/steering/ (if available)  
3. Implement ONLY the specified task
4. Follow all project conventions and leverage existing code
5. Mark the task as complete in tasks.md
6. Provide a completion summary

Context files to load:
- .claude/specs/{feature-name}/requirements.md
- .claude/specs/{feature-name}/design.md
- .claude/specs/{feature-name}/tasks.md  
- .claude/steering/product.md (if exists)
- .claude/steering/tech.md (if exists)
- .claude/steering/structure.md (if exists)

Task to implement: {task-id}
\`\`\`

**Manual Execution (Fallback)**: If the agent is not available, follow this process:

1. **Prerequisites**
   - Ensure tasks.md exists and is approved
   - Load the spec documents from \`.claude/specs/{feature-name}/\`:
     - Load \`.claude/specs/{feature-name}/requirements.md\` for feature requirements
     - Load \`.claude/specs/{feature-name}/design.md\` for technical design
     - Load \`.claude/specs/{feature-name}/tasks.md\` for the complete task list
   - **Load all steering documents** (if available): 
     - Load .claude/steering/product.md for product context
     - Load .claude/steering/tech.md for technical patterns
     - Load .claude/steering/structure.md for project conventions
   - Identify the specific task to execute

2. **Process**
   1. Load spec documents from \`.claude/specs/{feature-name}/\` directory:
      - Load requirements.md, design.md, and tasks.md for complete context
   2. Execute ONLY the specified task (never multiple tasks)
   3. Implement following existing code patterns and conventions
   4. Validate implementation against referenced requirements
   5. Run tests and checks if applicable
   6. **CRITICAL**: Mark task as complete by changing [ ] to [x] in tasks.md
   7. Confirm task completion status to user
   8. **CRITICAL**: Stop and wait for user review before proceeding

3. **Task Execution**
   - Focus on ONE task at a time
   - If task has sub-tasks, start with those
   - Follow the implementation details from design.md
   - Verify against requirements specified in the task

4. **Implementation Guidelines**
   - Write clean, maintainable code
   - **Follow steering documents**: Adhere to patterns in tech.md and conventions in structure.md
   - Follow existing code patterns and conventions
   - Include appropriate error handling
   - Add unit tests where specified
   - Document complex logic

5. **Validation**
   - Verify implementation meets acceptance criteria
   - Run tests if they exist
   - Check for lint/type errors
   - Ensure integration with existing code

6. **Task Completion Protocol**
When completing any task during \`/spec-execute\`:
   1. **Update tasks.md**: Change task status from \`- [ ]\` to \`- [x]\`
   2. **Confirm to user**: State clearly "Task X has been marked as complete"
   3. **Stop execution**: Do not proceed to next task automatically
   4. **Wait for instruction**: Let user decide next steps

## Critical Workflow Rules

### Task Execution
- **ONLY** execute one task at a time during implementation
- **CRITICAL**: Mark completed tasks as [x] in tasks.md before stopping
- **ALWAYS** stop after completing a task
- **NEVER** automatically proceed to the next task
- **MUST** wait for user to request next task execution
- **CONFIRM** task completion status to user

### Requirement References
- **ALL** tasks must reference specific requirements using _Requirements: X.Y_ format
- **ENSURE** traceability from requirements through design to implementation
- **VALIDATE** implementations against referenced requirements

## Task Selection
If no task-id specified:
- Look at tasks.md for the spec
- Recommend the next pending task
- Ask user to confirm before proceeding

If no feature-name specified:
- Check \`.claude/specs/\` directory for available specs
- If only one spec exists, use it
- If multiple specs exist, ask user which one to use
- Display error if no specs are found

## Examples
\`\`\`
/spec-execute 1 user-authentication
/spec-execute 2.1 user-authentication
\`\`\`

## Important Rules
- Only execute ONE task at a time
- **ALWAYS** mark completed tasks as [x] in tasks.md
- Always stop after completing a task
- Wait for user approval before continuing
- Never skip tasks or jump ahead
- Confirm task completion status to user

## Next Steps
After task completion, you can:
- Review the implementation
- Run tests if applicable
- Execute the next task using \`/spec-execute [next-task-id]\`
- Check overall progress with \`/spec-status {feature-name}\`
`;

}

export function getSpecSteeringSetupCommand(): string {
  return `# Spec Steering Setup Command

Create or update steering documents that provide persistent project context.

## Usage
\`\`\`
/spec-steering-setup
\`\`\`

## Instructions
You are helping set up steering documents that will guide all future spec development. These documents provide persistent context about the product vision, technology stack, and project structure.

## Process

1. **Check for Existing Steering Documents**
   - Look for \`.claude/steering/\` directory
   - Check for existing product.md, tech.md, structure.md files
   - If they exist, load and display current content

2. **Analyze the Project**
   - Review the codebase to understand:
     - Project type and purpose
     - Technology stack in use
     - Directory structure and patterns
     - Coding conventions
     - Existing features and functionality
   - Look for:
     - package.json, requirements.txt, go.mod, etc.
     - README files
     - Configuration files
     - Source code structure

3. **Present Inferred Details**
   - Show the user what you've learned about:
     - **Product**: Purpose, features, target users
     - **Technology**: Frameworks, libraries, tools
     - **Structure**: File organization, naming conventions
   - Format as:
     \`\`\`
     Based on my analysis, here's what I've inferred:
     
     **Product Details:**
     - [Inferred detail 1]
     - [Inferred detail 2]
     
     **Technology Stack:**
     - [Inferred tech 1]
     - [Inferred tech 2]
     
     **Project Structure:**
     - [Inferred pattern 1]
     - [Inferred pattern 2]
     \`\`\`
   - Ask: "Do these inferred details look correct? Please let me know which ones to keep or discard."

4. **Gather Missing Information**
   - Based on user feedback, identify gaps
   - Ask targeted questions to fill in missing details:
     
     **Product Questions:**
     - What is the main problem this product solves?
     - Who are the primary users?
     - What are the key business objectives?
     - What metrics define success?
     
     **Technology Questions:**
     - Are there any technical constraints or requirements?
     - What third-party services are integrated?
     - What are the performance requirements?
     
     **Structure Questions:**
     - Are there specific coding standards to follow?
     - How should new features be organized?
     - What are the testing requirements?

5. **Generate Steering Documents**
   - Create \`.claude/steering/\` directory if it doesn't exist
   - Generate three files based on templates and gathered information:
     
     **product.md**: Product vision, users, features, objectives
     **tech.md**: Technology stack, tools, constraints, decisions
     **structure.md**: File organization, naming conventions, patterns

6. **Review and Confirm**
   - Present the generated documents to the user
   - Ask for final approval before saving
   - Make any requested adjustments

## Important Notes

- **Steering documents are persistent** - they will be referenced in all future spec commands
- **Keep documents focused** - each should cover its specific domain
- **Update regularly** - steering docs should evolve with the project
- **Never include sensitive data** - no passwords, API keys, or credentials

## Example Flow

1. Analyze project and find it's a React/TypeScript app
2. Present inferred details about the e-commerce platform
3. User confirms most details but clarifies target market
4. Ask about performance requirements and third-party services
5. Generate steering documents with all gathered information
6. User reviews and approves the documents
7. Save to \`.claude/steering/\` directory

## Next Steps
After steering documents are created, they will automatically be referenced during:
- \`/spec-create\` - Align requirements with product vision
- \`/spec-design\` - Follow established tech patterns
- \`/spec-tasks\` - Use correct file organization
- \`/spec-execute\` - Implement following all conventions
`;
}

export function getBugCreateCommand(): string {
  return `# Bug Create Command

Initialize a new bug fix workflow for tracking and resolving bugs.

## Usage
\`\`\`
/bug-create <bug-name> [description]
\`\`\`

## Workflow Overview

This is the **streamlined bug fix workflow** - a lighter alternative to the full spec workflow for addressing bugs and issues.

### Bug Fix Phases
1. **Report Phase** (This command) - Document the bug
2. **Analysis Phase** (\`/bug-analyze\`) - Investigate root cause
3. **Fix Phase** (\`/bug-fix\`) - Implement solution
4. **Verification Phase** (\`/bug-verify\`) - Confirm resolution

## Instructions

You are helping create a new bug fix workflow. This is designed for smaller fixes that don't need the full spec workflow overhead.

1. **Create Directory Structure**
   - Create \`.claude/bugs/{bug-name}/\` directory
   - Initialize report.md, analysis.md, and verification.md files

2. **Load Context** (if available)
   - Check for .claude/steering/tech.md for technical context
   - Check for .claude/steering/structure.md for project patterns
   - Load available steering documents to understand project context

3. **Gather Bug Information**
   - Take the bug name and optional description
   - Guide user through bug report creation
   - Use structured format for consistency

4. **Generate Bug Report**
   - **Template to Follow**: Use the exact structure from \`.claude/templates/bug-report-template.md\`
   - **Read and follow**: Load the template and follow all sections precisely
   - Create detailed bug description following the template structure

## Template Usage
- **Follow exact structure**: Use \`.claude/templates/bug-report-template.md\` precisely
- **Include all sections**: Don't omit any required template sections
- **Structured format**: Follow the template's format for consistency

5. **Request User Input**
   - Ask for bug details if not provided in description
   - Guide through each section of the bug report
   - Ensure all required information is captured

6. **Save and Proceed**
   - Save the completed bug report to report.md
   - Ask: "Is this bug report accurate? If so, we can move on to the analysis."
   - Wait for explicit approval before proceeding
   - **WHEN APPROVED**: Add "✅ APPROVED" at the top of report.md after the main heading

## Key Differences from Spec Workflow

- **Faster**: No requirements/design phases
- **Targeted**: Focus on fixing existing functionality
- **Streamlined**: 4 phases instead of detailed workflow
- **Practical**: Direct from problem to solution

## Rules

- Only create ONE bug fix at a time
- Always use kebab-case for bug names
- Must analyze existing codebase during investigation
- Follow existing project patterns and conventions
- Do not proceed without user approval between phases

## Error Handling

If issues arise during the workflow:
- **Bug unclear**: Ask targeted questions to clarify
- **Too complex**: Suggest breaking into smaller bugs or using spec workflow
- **Reproduction blocked**: Document blockers and suggest alternatives

## Example
\`\`\`
/bug-create login-timeout "Users getting logged out too quickly"
\`\`\`

## Next Steps
After bug report approval, proceed to \`/bug-analyze\` phase.
`;
}

export function getBugAnalyzeCommand(): string {
  return `# Bug Analyze Command

Investigate and analyze the root cause of a reported bug.

## Usage
\`\`\`
/bug-analyze [bug-name]
